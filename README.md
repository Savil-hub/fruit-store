## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (>=3.x)
- Docker
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) (for creating a virtual environment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

### With venv

1. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### With Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 your-image-name
    ```

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
