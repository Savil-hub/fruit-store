They can discharge varying amounts of electricity from their body to manipulate as they please, including regulate the voltage: 200 million volts being the maximum output (roughly in the range of natural lightning). Given the sheer destructive power that is inherent to lightning, this ability seems remarkably strong even by Logia standards and grants overwhelming attack power, as well as high speed and versatility. The Goro Goro no Mi's power is one of the few considered invincible.</p>

Due to this, the user can absorb physical matter and attacks of any type by sucking it into the darkness. The user can also use this ability to irresistibly pull the opponent to them, regardless of their current state.Similar to a black hole, the user can absorb things inside a vortex. It seems that it does not completely compress and annihilate that which is sucked in as an actual black hole would do, but rather creates some form of space where things are stored. In addition to the previous abilities, this fruit somehow has one unique and frightening ability that separates it from all other Devil Fruits: the ability to absorb and completely nullify the powers of other Devil Fruit users by simply touching them.</p>

In this case, the user is able to create, control, and become fire. With this in mind, the user can create devastating fire-based attacks and gain a high resistance towards most heat-based attacks. The flames can also be used to increase the force of physical attacks. By turning into fire, the user is capable of letting enemy attacks harmlessly pass through their fiery body or move around quickly in a stream of flames. Igniting oneself similarly has the added effect of burning an opponent if they had tried to physically harm the user.</p>
